This is is a VMM that uses VT-x on 32 bit machines.   

It is based on GeekOS, VmxAssist, BOCHS BIOS/VGABIOS, and code
for playing around with VT and VT-X in the GeekOS context

Here are some things you need to know:


Serial port I/O is used to communicate with the VMM.  This means
you need a null modem connection between your test machine and your
dev machine.  

To configure serial on your dev machine:

(as root, or other user who has access to the serial port):
  
   stty -F /dev/ttyS0 115200   (assume 8 bit, no parity already set)
   
Then use kermit to communicate:

   kermit -l /dev/ttyS0
     set carrier-watch off
     connect

To access the ethernet power switch:

  
   ifconfig eth0:1 up 192.168.0.4 (this is your address)

Now you should be able to connect to http://192.168.0.100


To build from scratch:

cd build
make clean
make 
make generate_sizes
make clean
make pxe

This will copy the final image into /tftpboot so that if you have PXE
boot properly configured, the test machine will boot from it over the
network.

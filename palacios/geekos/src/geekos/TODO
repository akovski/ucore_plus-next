Get Relocation working
	code audit to ensure no compile time addresses are generated (globals)
	figure out how to get the .asm files to work
		thoughts: add a GOT table somewhere, 
			  setup a special 'ASM' gdt entry for code/data

64 bit porting work...
	change register ops to work with 64 bit values
		e.g. Get/Set_MSR
	get a 64/32 bit register abstraction that is GOOD
		see reg_ex_t in vmm_util.h

Support allocating multiple contiguous pages in geekos
	either rewrite allocator or just step through until you find one
